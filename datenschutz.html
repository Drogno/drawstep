                        <p><h3>Information about the responsible party (referred to as the “controller” in the GDPR)</h3>
The data processing controller on this website is:
Gordon Janicke

Phone: 0171 8296970
E-mail: info@drawstep.de

                            <p><h3>Storage duration</h3>
Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain
with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for
deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally
permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the
latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>

                                <p><h3>General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website</h3>
If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or
Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the case of

                                    <p><h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various external parties. In some cases, this also
requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal data to external
parties if this is required as part of the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g.,
disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f)
GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data. When using processors, we only disclose personal
data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract on data processing. In the case of joint processing, a joint
processing agreement is concluded.</p>

                                    <p><h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also
revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness
of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>

                                    <p><h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct
advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON
GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED
ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS
BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE
WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO
PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA,
THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE
PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION
PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING,
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR
THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE
EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES
(OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).</p>

                                            <p><h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory
agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the
place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other
administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.</p>

                                            <p><h3>Right to data portability</h3>
You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of
a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you should
demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.</p>

                                            <p><h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to demand information about
your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data
at any time. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about
this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any
time.</p>

                                            <p><h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is
concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in
the following cases:
In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need
some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to
demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to
demand the restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.
If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
of its eradication.
If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be
weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their archiving –
may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to
protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by

For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser
switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

                                            <p><h3>Encrypted payment transactions on this website</h3>
If you are under an obligation to share your payment information (e.g. account number if you give us the
authority to debit your bank account) with us after you have entered into a fee-based contract with us, this
information is required to process payments.
Payment transactions using common modes of paying (Visa/MasterCard, debit to your bank account) are
processed exclusively via encrypted SSL or TLS connections. You can recognize an encrypted connection by
checking whether the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the
appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will not be able to read the payment information you
share with us.</p>

                    <p><h3>Cookies</h3>
Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as “cookies.” Cookies are small data packages that do
not cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session
(session cookies) or they are permanently archived on your device (permanent cookies). Session cookies are
automatically deleted once you terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on your device
until you actively delete them, or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.
Cookies can be issued by us (first-party cookies) or by third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies).
Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services of third-party companies into websites (e.g.,
cookies for handling payment services).
Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically essential since certain website functions
would not work in the absence of these cookies (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos).
Other cookies may be used to analyze user behavior or for promotional purposes.
Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic communication transactions, for the provision
of certain functions you want to use (e.g., for the shopping cart function) or those that are necessary for the
optimization (required cookies) of the website (e.g., cookies that provide measurable insights into the web
audience), shall be stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, unless a different legal basis is cited. The
operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the storage of required cookies to ensure the technically
error-free and optimized provision of the operator’s services. If your consent to the storage of the cookies
and similar recognition technologies has been requested, the processing occurs exclusively on the basis of
the consent obtained (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TDDDG); this consent may be revoked at any time.
You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner that you will be notified any time cookies are
placed and to permit the acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may also exclude the acceptance of
cookies in certain cases or in general or activate the delete-function for the automatic eradication of cookies
when the browser closes. If cookies are deactivated, the functions of this website may be limited.
Which cookies and services are used on this website can be found in this privacy policy.</p>

If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name,
request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these
data on without your consent.
These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a
contract or is required for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the data are
processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art.
6(1)(f) GDPR) or on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been obtained; the consent can be
revoked at any time.
The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your
consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request).
Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>
